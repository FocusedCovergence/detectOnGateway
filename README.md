This is repo for CS 563 project: Temporal Graph Neural Network detect IoT targeted attacks in Real-Time

MITM_logs and runsomeware_logs are the logs captured by zeek

sniffer_features.zeek can be used for capture the corresponding features need for training in the model

Model saved in saved_model_TFNESAGE_v1, still need revising for accuracy, more detail in report.pdf
